# Regression on Parkinson’s disease data
 
Dopamine is a substance that makes muscles movement smooth and also coordinated. Substantia nigra is the name of the brain part dopamine produces. Every time the cell of Substantia dies, dopamine  levels reduce, then the symptoms of Parkinson appear. Early signs of that are in the movement’s problems  and bradykinesia  (slowness  of  movement).  That  is  why  patients  who  are  undergoing  Parkinson’s cannot control their muscles all the time. After Alzheimer’s disease, the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder is Parkinson’s disease (PD) which is affecting over 1% of individuals over the age of 60.  However, the number of people who came down with PD is 930,000 in the United States; this number will reach 1.2 million people by 2030.
