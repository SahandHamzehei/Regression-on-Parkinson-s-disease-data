# Predicting the Total Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Using ML Techniques and Cloud-Based Update

## Introduction
Smart health technologies are becoming increasingly integral in areas such as healthcare, smart living, cognitive smart cities, and social systems. This project is centered on leveraging machine learning techniques and cloud-computing solutions to predict the total UPDRS for Parkinson's disease patients.

## Abstract
Data collection, especially through IoT-assisted sensors, is revolutionizing how physicians predict, prevent, and treat diseases. Machine Learning offers heightened accuracy in medical prognosis based on this data. In this study, we assess four ML methods against Parkinson’s disease data to understand their performance and determine the critical features for predicting the total UPDRS. Given the importance of real-time updates for physicians and IoT nodes, the data is stored in the cloud, safeguarded with rule-based updates. Cloud computing's added resources reduce the temporal complexity of training ML algorithms, especially in a cloud/edge architecture setup. The results, analyzed using the coefficient of determination and Mean Square Error, show a generally acceptable performance level.

## Key Findings
- **Motor UPDRS** stands out as the most significant predictor of Total UPDRS.
- Cloud computing aids in reducing the time complexity of ML training.
- The results of the applied ML methods are majorly within acceptable performance standards.
